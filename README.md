# Cool Python Project

This is a **simple weather simulator** project written in Python.

## Files
- `app.py`: Main entry point. Runs the program and asks the user for a city name.
- `weather.py`: Generates fake weather reports using random numbers.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
1. Open this folder in **VS Code**.
2. Open the integrated terminal (**View > Terminal**).
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Type any city name, and you'll get a fake weather report!

Example:
```
Enter a city name: Toronto
The weather in Toronto today is rainy 🌧️ with 12°C.
```
